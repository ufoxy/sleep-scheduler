This project was created with the intuition to help people find the right time to sleep or wake up for a healthy night's sleep.

To calculate a good night's sleep, it is necessary to use the sleep schedule in 90-minute cycles as a basis. In this project i used these cycles to calculate.

See how it's used: www.youtube.com.br
